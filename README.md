# True Co-op Mod
The True Co-op Mod for Binding of Isaac, found on steam here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1230784774

It enables replacing co-op babies with standard playable characters, which can collect and use items as usual.

This mod is one of the hackiest mods out there and not the best organized, so contribute at your own risk.
